This is a personal project that I took on because I wanted to continue to explore the possibilities of web languages.  Specifically how the LAMP stack works. I have chosen to use many different versions of JavaScript because of how different they are in the world of programming. While most of the CSS was not touched, I have made modifications as needed to it from the original provided by Laravel. For now, the web page does have a few elements of my modifications but eventually, it is my intent to have it so that if you just visit the site by itself, there is nothing special about it but if you happen to enter my name it will show other pages.

Built with PHP 5.6, JS 6.9.4, MySQL 14.14 Dist 5.7.17

HTML makes use of the new HTML5 tags

Scripts that are used to convert files from metadata to sql inserts are provided in the imports folder which can be modified beyond what is there.
