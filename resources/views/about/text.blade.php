<p class="left-align">I am a recent college grad playing around with the LAMP stack. My first job out of college inspired me to pursue full stack development. This project was principally for me to understand what goes into real web design and to better understand different JS libraries. I have attempted to design each page as well as I could and in the process learning about CSS as much as possible.</p>

<p class="left-align">This site makes use of the Laravel PHP framework as its back bone for routing and controlling the passage of information from the MySQL database to the frontend. Each page makes use of a different JS library except for this one.</p>

<p class="left-align">How it works:<br>On the homepage, hit tab folled by either the wasd or the arrow keys<br>On the photo page, try just hitting wasd or arrow keys. Some of the nature shots will play a sound when clicked.<br>Sadly this does not work on all browsers at this time</p>
